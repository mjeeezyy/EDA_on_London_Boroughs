Correlation analysis on population spread in London city boroughs
I used 3 datasets, namely Employment Rate, Industry & London Census to answer questions like 'What is the most populated area in London', 
'Why is that area highly populated', 'Is the employment rate high/low in the most populated area in London', 
'What employment industries have the highest employment in the most populated area in London'. Afterwards, I performed correlation
analysis to quantify the amount of linear correspondance between two variables in the London Census dataset. With a view to model the 
relationship between the two variables chosen for correlation analysis, I then built a couple of regression models.
